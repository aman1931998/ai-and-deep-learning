Please download dataset from given link.

Competition Info: Animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to the metadata associated with their online profiles, such as descriptive text and photo characteristics. As one example, PetFinder is currently experimenting with a simple AI tool called the Cuteness Meter, which ranks how cute a pet is based on qualities present in their photos.

In this competition you will be developing algorithms to predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly is a pet adopted? If successful, they will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world on improving their pet profiles' appeal, reducing animal suffering and euthanization.

Methodology used: Custom Neural Network by joining two neural networks (ANN + CNN).

Implemented using python programming language, modules used are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, json, cv2, os, scipy and math.
